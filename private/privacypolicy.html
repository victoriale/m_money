    <p>We respect your online privacy. We acknowledge your right to manage any
      personal information that may identify you ("Personal Information"). By
      Personal Information we are referring to any information that may be used
      to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last
      name, personal profile, a home or other physical address and an email
      address or other contact information. In order to provide you with the
      Site's services, you must create a profile, register and provide your
      email address, username, password and other specified information. At a
      later time, you may add additional Personal Information to your profile.</p>

    <p>As a registered user, you are able to send messages to and receive messages
      from other registered users and contributors. You are strictly prohibited
      from sending unsolicited or unauthorized advertisements or solicitations,
      spam, chain letters, etc. You should be aware that some actions you take,
      such as replying to a topic, posting comments, responding to advertisements,
      etc. may result in your receiving notifications in your InvestKit account.
      Some notifications, such as a notification for receiving a private message
      to your InvestKit account, may be enabled by default.</p>

    <p>We may use your email address/account to send updates, a newsletter or news
      regarding our services, and those of our advertisers who may have relevant offers.</p>

    <p>If you choose not to receive email from a particular sender, you can roll
      your mouse over the text of an email in your email account and block that
      sender. If you receive the email from InvestKit in an email account other
      than the account that you provided InvestKit and wish to block that sender,
      simply block that sender in the same way. Furthermore, if you do not wish to
      receive email from one of our advertisers, you may unsubscribe from receiving
      further email from that advertiser. If you choose to provide us with your
      Personal Information on the Site, we may transfer that Personal Information
      within InvestKit or to InvestKit's third-party service providers, but only
      to provide services on the Site, across borders, and from your country or
      jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. The services
      provided by our third-party service providers may include fulfilling orders,
      providing customer service and marketing assistance, performing business and
      sales analysis, supporting our website functionality, and supporting contests,
      surveys and other features offered through our Site. If any transactions are
      conducted, we may also share your name, contact information and credit card
      information with our authorized service providers who process credit card
      payments. These service providers may have access to personal information
      needed to perform their functions, but are not permitted to share or use such
      information for any other purpose.</p>

    <p>InvestKit strives to comply with all applicable laws around the globe that
      are designed to protect your privacy. Although legal requirements may vary
      from country to country, InvestKit intends to adhere to the principles set
      forth in this Privacy Policy even if, in connection with the above, we transfer
      your Personal Information from your country to countries that may not require
      an "adequate" level of protection for your Personal Information. In other
      words, our goal is to provide protection for your Personal Information no
      matter where that Personal Information is collected, transferred, or retained.</p>

    <p>Finally, we may disclose your Personal Information or any information you
      submitted via the Site and its services if we have a good faith belief that
      disclosure of such information is helpful or reasonably necessary to i) comply
      with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request,
      ii) enforce our Terms of Service, including investigations of potential
      violations thereof, iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud or
      security issues, or iv) protect against harm to the rights, property or
      safety of InvestKit, its users, yourself or the public.</p>

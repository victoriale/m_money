    <li><b>Securities Disclaimer</b><br /><br />

The user further acknowledges that no content provider, including InvestKit, news providers, bloggers, advertisers or their affiliates are giving advise concerning the suitability, value, or potential value of any specific security, group of securities, portfolio of securities, or investment strategy or other financial or investment matter. To the extent that any of the content published on the Site may be deemed to be investment advice or recommendations in connection with a specific security, the user acknowledges that the information is impersonal and not tailored to their or any user's investment needs. Investments in securities, by their nature have inherent and sometimes hidden risks.

InvestKit strongly recommends that any user seek the advice of qualified investment professionals and other financial advisors prior to any investment or securities transaction.</p>
      <p>The user acknowledges that content on InvestKit may present opinions from various sources such as financial reporters, bloggers, and other users. The user acknowledges that those content providers may write about securities in which they or their firms have a position, and that they may trade for their own account, and that they may or may not be subject to a disclosure policy. InvestKit strongly recommends that any user seek the advice of qualified investment professionals and other financial advisors prior to any investment or securities transaction.</p>
      <p>The user acknowledges that all data, including information regarding the performance of various securities and companies, is provided by sources InvestKit believes to be reliable; however, the information is not always guaranteed to be accurate by the provider and therefore, the user acknowledges that the calculations herein are made using such data, and that such calculations are not guaranteed by these sources, the information providers, or any other person or entity, and may not be complete.</p>
      <p>The user acknowledges that information regarding financial and security transactions is often time sensitive.

    <li><b>InvestKit Does Not Recommend Or Give Advice</b><br /><br />
      <p>The InvestKit Site is not intended to provide tax, legal, insurance or investment advice, and nothing on the Site should be construed as an offer to sell, a solicitation of an offer to buy, or a recommendation for any security by InvestKit or any third party. Each user is responsible for doing their own due diligence and determining the advisability, suitability and appropriateness of the user's decisions and transactions regarding the sale or purchase of securities.

        <p>We respect your online privacy. We acknowledge your right to manage any
          personal information that may identify you ("Personal Information"). By
          Personal Information we are referring to any information that may be used
          to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last
          name, personal profile, a home or other physical address and an email
          address or other contact information. In order to provide you with the
          Site's services, you must create a profile, register and provide your
          email address, username, password and other specified information. At a
          later time, you may add additional Personal Information to your profile.</p>

        <p>As a registered user, you are able to send messages to and receive messages
          from other registered users and contributors. You are strictly prohibited
          from sending unsolicited or unauthorized advertisements or solicitations,
          spam, chain letters, etc. You should be aware that some actions you take,
          such as replying to a topic, posting comments, responding to advertisements,
          etc. may result in your receiving notifications in your InvestKit account.
          Some notifications, such as a notification for receiving a private message
          to your InvestKit account, may be enabled by default.</p>

        <p>We may use your email address/account to send updates, a newsletter or news
          regarding our services, and those of our advertisers who may have relevant offers.</p>

        <p>If you choose not to receive email from a particular sender, you can roll
          your mouse over the text of an email in your email account and block that
          sender. If you receive the email from InvestKit in an email account other
          than the account that you provided InvestKit and wish to block that sender,
          simply block that sender in the same way. Furthermore, if you do not wish to
          receive email from one of our advertisers, you may unsubscribe from receiving
          further email from that advertiser. If you choose to provide us with your
          Personal Information on the Site, we may transfer that Personal Information
          within InvestKit or to InvestKit's third-party service providers, but only
          to provide services on the Site, across borders, and from your country or
          jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. The services
          provided by our third-party service providers may include fulfilling orders,
          providing customer service and marketing assistance, performing business and
          sales analysis, supporting our website functionality, and supporting contests,
          surveys and other features offered through our Site. If any transactions are
          conducted, we may also share your name, contact information and credit card
          information with our authorized service providers who process credit card
          payments. These service providers may have access to personal information
          needed to perform their functions, but are not permitted to share or use such
          information for any other purpose.</p>

        <p>InvestKit strives to comply with all applicable laws around the globe that
          are designed to protect your privacy. Although legal requirements may vary
          from country to country, InvestKit intends to adhere to the principles set
          forth in this Privacy Policy even if, in connection with the above, we transfer
          your Personal Information from your country to countries that may not require
          an "adequate" level of protection for your Personal Information. In other
          words, our goal is to provide protection for your Personal Information no
          matter where that Personal Information is collected, transferred, or retained.</p>

        <p>Finally, we may disclose your Personal Information or any information you
          submitted via the Site and its services if we have a good faith belief that
          disclosure of such information is helpful or reasonably necessary to i) comply
          with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request,
          ii) enforce our Terms of Service, including investigations of potential
          violations thereof, iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud or
          security issues, or iv) protect against harm to the rights, property or
          safety of InvestKit, its users, yourself or the public.</p>

            <p>A "Web Cookie" is a string of information that a website stores on a user's computer, and that the user's browser provides to the website each time the user submits a query to the site. We use Web Cookies to track the pages that users visit during each Site session, both to help us improve users' experiences and to help us understand how the Site is being used. As with other non-Personal Information gathered from users of the Site, we analyze and disclose in aggregated form information gathered using Web Cookies, so as to help us, our partners and others better understand how the Site is being used. We do not attempt to link information gathered using Web Cookies to Personal Information. USERS WHO DO NOT WISH TO HAVE WEB COOKIES PLACED ON THEIR COMPUTERS SHOULD SET THEIR BROWSERS TO REFUSE WEB COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THE SITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE SITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF WEB COOKIES.

          <li>Web Beacons<br />
            <p>A "Web Beacon" is an object that is embedded in a web page that is usually invisible to the user and allows website operators to check whether a user has viewed a particular web page or an email. We may use Web Beacons on the Site and in emails to count users who have visited particular pages, viewed emails, and to deliver co-branded services. Web Beacons are not used to access users' Personal Information; they are a technique we may use to compile aggregated statistics about Site usage. Web Beacons collect only a limited set of information, including a Web Cookie number, time and date of a page or email view, and a description of the page or email on which the Web Beacon resides. You may not decline Web Beacons; however, they can be rendered ineffective by declining all Web Cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a Web Cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline Web Cookies on an individual basis.</p>

                <li>Web Cookies<br>
                  A "Web Cookie" is a string of information that a website stores on a user's computer, and that the user's browser provides to the website each time the user submits a query to the site. We use Web Cookies to track the pages that users visit during each Site session, both to help us improve users' experiences and to help us understand how the Site is being used. As with other non-Personal Information gathered from users of the Site, we analyze and disclose in aggregated form information gathered using Web Cookies, so as to help us, our partners and others better understand how the Site is being used. We do not attempt to link information gathered using Web Cookies to Personal Information. USERS WHO DO NOT WISH TO HAVE WEB COOKIES PLACED ON THEIR COMPUTERS SHOULD SET THEIR BROWSERS TO REFUSE WEB COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THE SITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE SITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF WEB COOKIES. USERS WHO REFUSE WEB COOKIES ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY.

                <li>Web Beacons<br>
                  A "Web Beacon" is an object that is embedded in a web page that is usually invisible to the user and allows website operators to check whether a user has viewed a particular web page or an email. We may use Web Beacons on the Site and in emails to count users who have visited particular pages, viewed emails, and to deliver co-branded services. Web Beacons are not used to access users' Personal Information; they are a technique we may use to compile aggregated statistics about Site usage. Web Beacons collect only a limited set of information, including a Web Cookie number, time and date of a page or email view, and a description of the page or email on which the Web Beacon resides. You may not decline Web Beacons; however, they can be rendered ineffective by declining all Web Cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a Web Cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline Web Cookies on an individual basis.
